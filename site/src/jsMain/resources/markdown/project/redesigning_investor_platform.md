An investment platform that connects early-stage companies with potential investors embarked on a full redesign of their investor platform to enhance usability and visual appeal, ultimately driving user adoption and engagement.

{{{ .components.template.showcase.ShowcaseSection("Challenge")

Investors using the investor platform faced significant hurdles when trying to make informed investment decisions:

- Incomplete information about potential investments
- Confusingly presented company information and business plans
- A complex, multi-step investment process

The central problem: accredited investors seeking high returns through early-stage investments struggled to make informed decisions due to unclear and inaccessible information, leading to potential investment regret.

{{{ .components.template.showcase.ShowcaseSection("Solution")

Through collaborative research with the Product Manager and client, including mapping the investorâ€™s journey, and creating a new information architecture, the application was redesigned with these key improvements:

### Portfolio Dashboard

Created a holistic view of investment performance with at-a-glance metrics and visualizations, allowing investors to quickly assess portfolio progress and identify opportunities.

### Streamlined Company Discovery

Implemented powerful search and filtering capabilities to help investors easily find companies matching their investment criteria, whether actively fundraising or planning future rounds.

### Enhanced Company Profiles

Transformed company profiles into comprehensive resource centers with clear, engaging overviews of mission, team, market position, and other key details. Content is now tailored based on user profiles, providing targeted information for both prospective and existing investors.

### Simplified Investment Process

Streamlined the investment workflow to make it intuitive and efficient, allowing investors to explore, evaluate, and invest in promising opportunities directly from the platform.
