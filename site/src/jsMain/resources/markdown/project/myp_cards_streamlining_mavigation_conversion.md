MYP Cards, an online marketplace for trading card games, was experiencing high user drop-off rates during the buying
process. The platform, primarily designed by engineers, lacked a user-centric approach, resulting in a confusing
navigation flow and cumbersome checkout process. This led to poor conversion rates, high cart abandonment, and
significant lost sales.

**Impact:**
- Optimized navigation for clarity and discoverability
- Elevated UX with simplified and purposeful interface

{{{ .components.template.showcase.ShowcaseSection("Identifying areas for improvement")

The existing website was evaluated in order to map key issues, which were prioritized according to the business goals.
This provided a data-driven foundation for understanding potential problems affecting users.

{{{ .components.molecule.ShowcaseLargeCard(title="Desktop navigation", image="/assets/projects/MYP/Myp-navigation-before-desktop.jpg")

The main navigation lacked a clear hierarchy and excessive and unnecessary information, overwhelming users and making it difficult to find essential features.  Search functionality was limited to the selected category, preventing users from searching all available card games.

The mobile interface presented key challenges in terms of responsiveness and crowded menus for products and profile. Inconsistency in brand colour usage, such as menus with two different colours, detracted from a cohesive user experience.

{{{ .components.template.showcase.ShowcaseSection("Uncovering pain points")

After conducting interviews with some users from MYP Cards and mapping their journey, we gained valuable insights into
their needs and pain points, confirming some of the issues mapped during the first evaluation. The main pointed issues
were related to the search area and confused navigation.

In a summary, the main issues weâ€™re trying to solve are listed below:

{{{ .components.molecule.ShowcaseSmallCard

**Complex Navigation:** Users were confused by the unclear menus, hierarchy, and repetition of information

}}}

{{{ .components.molecule.ShowcaseSmallCard

**Inefficient Search Experience:** 82% of users reported difficulties finding specific cards due to limited search functionality restricted to selected categories

}}}

{{{ .components.molecule.ShowcaseSmallCard

**Cumbersome Checkout Process:** A lengthy checkout process with unnecessary steps led to 68% of users abandoning during this phase

}}}

}}}

{{{ .components.template.showcase.ShowcaseSection(title = "Solution")

A key focus was simplifying the search process for users. The goal was to make it more targeted and efficient, allowing
users to find desired cards quickly and easily. Informed by user research and card sorting exercises, the navigation was redesigned for both desktop and mobile, replacing the small, cumbersome menu with an intuitive menu organized according to the three test and card sorting experiments.

The new header has a cleaner look and prioritizes key functionalities, improving usability. One highlight was moving the search bar to a more prominent position and adding filter options, which enables users to search across different card types.

Unused functionalities were removed from the header, creating more clear space on the screen and focusing attention on the main functionalities. All the card categories were included within the new menu and have a clear hierarchy and categorization.

{{{ .components.template.showcase.ShowcaseSection("Looking Ahead")

Besides navigation, the checkout process was another key area identified for improvement during our research. Although the full solution hasn't been implemented yet, the work on this stage was essential.

Based on user flow mapping, it was possible eliminated unnecessary steps to reduce friction and encourage purchase completion. This process resulted in a new set of wireframes for a streamlined and efficient checkout flow, setting the foundation for future development.

{{{ .components.template.showcase.ShowcaseSection("The Ongoing Journey", level = "h3")

The MYP Cards user experience is an ongoing journey. While this case study focused on the critical improvements to search and navigation, a future project will delve into optimizing the checkout process to further enhance user satisfaction and drive sales. By continuously iterating and improving based on user feedback, MYP Cards can solidify its position as a leading online marketplace for trading card games.
