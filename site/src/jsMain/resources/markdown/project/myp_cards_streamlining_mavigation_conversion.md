MYP Cards, an online marketplace for trading card games, was experiencing high user drop-off rates during the buying
process. The platform, primarily designed by engineers, lacked a user-centric approach, resulting in a confusing
navigation flow and cumbersome checkout process. This led to poor conversion rates, high cart abandonment, and
significant lost sales.

Impact:

- Optimized navigation for clarity and discoverability
- Elevated UX with simplified and purposeful interface

### Due to the complex navigation, 80% of users abandoned their card search.

The existing website was evaluated in order to map key issues, which were prioritized according to the business goals.
This provided a data-driven foundation for understanding potential problems affecting users.

### A painful search process often led to cart abandonment before even users reach the checkout stage

After conducting interviews with some users from MYP Cards and mapping their journey, we gained valuable insights into
their needs and pain points, confirming some of the issues mapped during the first evaluation. The main pointed issues
were related to the search area and confused navigation.

In a summary, the main issues we’re trying to solve are listed below:

- **Complex Navigation:** Unintuitive menus with unclear hierarchy and information repetition confused users
- **Inefficient Search Experience:** 82% of users reported difficulties finding specific cards due to limited search
  functionality restricted to selected categories
- **Cumbersome Checkout Process:** A lengthy checkout process with unnecessary steps led to 67% of users abandoning
  during this phase

### Rethinking Information Architecture

A key focus was simplifying the search process for users. The goal was to make it more targeted and efficient, allowing
users to find desired cards quickly and easily. Informed by user research and card sorting exercises, the information
architecture of MYP Cards was redesigned, where the following aspects were implemented:

- Replaced the small, cumbersome menu with an intuitive mega menu organized according to the results of a card sorting
  experiment with users.
- Created a cleaner header with neutral colours to improve accessibility and navigation
- Relocated the search bar to a prominent position at the top center of the header
- Added filtering options enabling users to search across different categories of card types

### Streamlined Checkout Flow

During the research phase, another friction point was the lengthy checkout process. While the solution wasn’t fully
implemented, here are some initiatives taken at the time to streamline the checkout process.

- Mapped a clear user flow, eliminating unnecessary steps to reduce friction and encourage purchase completion
- Created wireframes based on the proposed flow for future implementation

The MYP Cards user experience is an ongoing journey. While this case study focused on search and navigation
improvements, future studies will delve into optimizing the checkout process to further enhance user satisfaction and
drive sales.

By continuously iterating and improving based on user feedback, MYP Cards can solidify its position as a leading online
marketplace for trading card games.
