Havaianas, a leading retail brand, sought to enhance the in-store shopping experience and empower their sales team. A common challenge in retail is "showrooming," where customers try products in-store but purchase them online elsewhere. To combat this, Havaianas envisioned a solution that would allow salespeople to showcase the entire product catalog – even items not physically in stock – directly to customers in a seamless and engaging way.

The core challenge was to **improve the checkout process for Havaianas salespeople** by delivering an intuitive and efficient tool. This web-based platform, designed with a **mobile-first approach**, would enable them to easily search the complete catalog and finalize customer purchases directly in-store.

Vitrine Infinita is a digital solution designed to bridge the gap between the physical store and the complete online catalog. By providing salespeople with a platform similar to an e-commerce site, customers could explore all available Havaianas products, regardless of in-store inventory. This aimed to prevent lost sales and create a more comprehensive and satisfying in-store experience, encouraging on-site purchases.

{{{ .components.template.showcase.ShowcaseSection("Impact")

The initial rollout of the Vitrine Infinita application in **100 pilot Havaianas** stores yielded significant results:

#### In-store sales increased by 27% following the application's launch.

Based on this success, the forecast was to expand and implement the application across all Havaianas stores, demonstrating the significant potential of the solution to transform the retail sales process.
