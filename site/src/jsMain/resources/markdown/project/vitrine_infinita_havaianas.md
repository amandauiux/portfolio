{{{ .components.template.showcase.ShowcaseHeader

Vitrine Infinita is a solution designed to help salespeople at Havaianas stores by presenting all the products available
in the Havaianas catalog to customers, including those that are not in-store, on a platform similar to an e-commerce
platform.

The solution prevents lost sales from showrooming by creating an improved in-store shopping experience that encourages
customers to buy onsite instead of searching for better deals elsewhere.

Due to confidentiality, details of the project were hidden. In case you’d like to know more about it, please contact me.

allowing them to search and complete a client’s purchase using a web platform, considering a mobile-first experience.

- In-store sales increased by 27% after the launch of the application in 100 pilot Havaianas’ stores.
