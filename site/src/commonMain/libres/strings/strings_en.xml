    <string name="about_my_journey_paragraph_1">
        My design journey has been anything but conventional. From the early days of exploring creativity with crayons
        to diving into the structured world of engineering, my path has been a unique blend of curiosity and discovery,
        ultimately leading me to UX/UI design.
    </string>
    <string name="about_my_journey_paragraph_2">
        A pivotal moment of self-discovery ignited my passion for design. Starting with graphic design, I built a strong
        foundation in visual aesthetics and communication. This exploration quickly evolved into a deep love for digital
        design, where I found my true calling. Today, as a UX/UI designer, I take pride in the non-linear path that
        brought me here and the experiences that have shaped my approach to design
